    Hey there from NucciTheBoss! I am currently in the process of evaluating tools for generating
    reference documentation from Python docstrings. Unfortunately, it is not super high on my list
    of priorities for the time being due to me just needing to get features into cleantest, but I
    plan on adding some reference documentation later on. If you have any recommendation for autogen
    tools or want to help me put together reference documentation, do not hesitate to get in touch!
    I know some of you might need the nitty gritty technical documentation!

    __Reference documentation will be added in cleantest 0.6.0__

!!! example "This page is currently under construction"

    Hey there from NucciTheBoss! I am in the process of creating some examples to demonstrate some of the cool things
    that you can do with cleantest such as creating a continuous integration pipeline on GitHub to test packages 
    or building your own micro-HPC cluster to test that your simulation works. Stay tuned!

    __Examples will be added in cleantest 0.5.0__
